ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* build.xml
* proguard-project.txt
* tests/
* tests/.DS_Store
* tests/.classpath
* tests/.project
* tests/.settings/
* tests/.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.core.prefs
* tests/bin/
* tests/bin/AndroidManifest.xml
* tests/bin/classes/
* tests/bin/classes/.DS_Store
* tests/bin/classes/com/
* tests/bin/classes/com/.DS_Store
* tests/bin/classes/com/example/
* tests/bin/classes/com/example/.DS_Store
* tests/bin/classes/com/example/hellojni/
* tests/bin/classes/com/example/hellojni/HelloJniTest.class
* tests/bin/classes/com/example/hellojni/tests/
* tests/bin/classes/com/example/hellojni/tests/BuildConfig.class
* tests/bin/jarlist.cache
* tests/build.xml
* tests/gen/
* tests/gen/com/
* tests/gen/com/example/
* tests/gen/com/example/hellojni/
* tests/gen/com/example/hellojni/tests/
* tests/gen/com/example/hellojni/tests/BuildConfig.java
* tests/local.properties
* tests/proguard-project.txt
* tests/project.properties

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* jni/ => app/src/main/jni/
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/
* tests/res/ => app/src/androidTest/res/
* tests/src/ => app/src/androidTest/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
